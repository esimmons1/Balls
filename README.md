# Balls

This program was made to learn more about physics using Processing 3 back in 2019. It simulates a group of balls bouncing around inside a box with gravity.

## How It Works

- Balls bounce off the edges of the box and each other.
- Each ballâ€™s size varies by about 10%.
- Gravity pulls the balls down, and you can adjust it.

## Controls

- Up / Down arrows: Change gravity strength
- Left / Right arrows: Change the base size of the balls
- Plus (+) / Minus (-): Change how many balls are in the box

## Why

Just a simple physics toy to play around with motion, collisions, and gravity.
